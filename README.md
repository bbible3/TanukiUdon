## Progress
Currently in progress on Milestone 1. On track to finish on time.
*Note: Unity Collaboration tools are being used for portions of this project. Content is stored locally in the [Unity-Home-Tanuki-Udon](Unity-Home-Tanuki-Udon/) folder and is available for download from Unity's servers. Assume that Unity's version is the latest. Files stored on this repo are our code - importing the VRCSDK into a Unity project manually is required. Where this folder is the root folder named "TanukiUdon540", the structure should essentially be: *(TanukiUdon540/Unity-Home-Tanuki-Udon/Tanuki Udon)* - with the *Tanuki Udon* folder containing ./Assets, ./Library, etc.
