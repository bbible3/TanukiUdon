For our test case, TanukiUdon would like to conduct real-world usage tests with a combination of new, as well as experienced VRChat world developers. 
The goal of this project is to lower the bar of entry to world development, as well as reduce time manually performing repeatable tasks. 


    |ID | Component     | Test case type  | Description                                                                        | Pass or Fail |
    |---|---------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | 1 | Installation  | Functionality   | Ensure the package installation procedure runs easily and without error            | -            | 
    | 2 | Backend       | Performance     | Ensure GameObjects are successfully converted to pickup even with a high number    | -            | 
    | 3 | UI            | Usability       | Ensure that the program layout and interaction is intuitive to fellow developers   | -            | 


Initially, we deem it preferable to begin testing with less experienced developers, so we can quickly determine necessary changes. We have determined 
multiple first candidates for testing, and ideally these tests will be conducted in person so we can monitor not only the end results but the individual's
interactions with the tool in general. Later down the road, we will advance to testing with more experienced developers as well.
