## Use Case 1
One potential use case for our project would involve an inexperienced and new VRC Developer. This developer obviously will not know very much about Udon Sharp
and how it changes the C# language. For all we know, this developer may not actually be a developer at all and may be brand new to the world of coding. Luckily,
since our program is GUI-based, the tools that we are providing will allow our new developer to accomplish many tasks easily without every really having to 
touch any of the code. At the moment, in the middle of Sprint 3.1, this new and inexperienced developer will be able to transform any GameObject of their
choosing into a teleporter, he will be able to create a loop between two specific teleporters, and he will be able to convert any combination of GameObjects
into GameObjects that are "pickup"-able in-game in VRChat.

## Use Case 2
However, this does not mean that our tool is only useful for new and inexperienced developers. Our main reason for creatign this project was to help everyone.
By creating this project, the same features are able to also help make the experienced developers' lives easier and less anoying. Bryce is an avid and active 
VRC developer and I am sure that he will be using our tool well after the end of this course, and probably continue to add functionality to it as well to help 
him accomplish more and more features in an easier and more automated way.
