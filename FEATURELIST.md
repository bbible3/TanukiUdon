* Featured as a plugin for Unity - Determine how to implement an importable UI based tool for Unity. This can be done by analysing other similar tools.
* GLSL to HLSL (Direct integration with ShaderToy) - Using code from [ShaderMan](https://github.com/smkplus/ShaderMan), we plan to implement a tool to automatically convert between web GLSL and HLSL Unity shaders. smkplus's ShaderMan tool supposedly does this, but it does not seem to function on modern Unity.
* U# Code Snippet Library - A feature to allow users to search using keywords for plugins they might find useful, and perhaps even add their own. Perhaps we can use the library available at [VRCPrefabs.com](https://vrcprefabs.com/)
* U# GitHub Code Search - A feature to allow users to input keywords and intelligently search publically available VRChat and U# code on GitHub.
* U# Autocomplete (IntelliSense style) - Perhaps this can be done by training some sort of autocomplete ML algorithm on Udon# code? Or done manually.
* U# Documentation & Helper (Clippy?) - A tool to auto-search for tutorials or documentation on VRChat's terrible wiki (and potentially use this to update VRchat's terrible wiki)
* Avatar Toggle Generator - This is a feature that I want to prioritise but have no idea how to begin. I need to research this before it's feasable.
